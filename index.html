          The Owner has requested and the Recipient agrees that the Recipient
          will protect the confidential material and information which may be
          disclosed between the Owner and the Recipient. Therefore, the parties
          agree as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>I. Confidential Information</strong> The term "Confidential
          Information" means any information or material which is proprietary to
          the Owner, whether or not owned or developed by the Owner, which is
          not generally known other than by the Owner, and which the Recipient
          may obtain through any direct or indirect contact with the Owner.
          Regardless of whether specifically identified as confidential or
          proprietary, Confidential Information shall include any information
          provided by the Owner concerning the business, technology and infor-
          mation of the Owner and any third party with which the Owner deals,
          including, without limitation, business records and plans, trade
          secrets, technical data, product ideas, contracts, financial
          information, pricing structure, discounts, computer programs and
          listings, source code and/or object code, copyrights and intellectual
          property, inventions, sales leads, strategic alliances, partners, and
          customer and client lists. The nature of the information and the
          manner of disclosure are such that a reasonable person would
          understand it to be confidential.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong>I. Confidential Information</strong> does not include
          <br /><br />

          - matters of public knowledge that result from disclosure by the
          Owner;<br />

          - information rightfully received by the Recipient from a third party
          without a duty of confidentiality;<br />

          -information independently developed by the Recipient;<br />

          - information disclosed by operation of law;<br />

          - information disclosed by the Recipient with the prior written
          consent of the Owner; <br />
          and any other information that both parties agree in writing is not
          confidential.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>II. PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. </strong>The
          Recipient understands and acknowledges that the Confidential
          Information has been developed or obtained by the Owner by the
          investment of significant time, effort and expense, and that the
          Confidential Information is a valuable, special and unique asset of
          the Owner which provides the Owner with a significant competitive
          advantage, and needs to be protected from improper disclosure. In
          consideration for the receipt by the Recipient of the Confidential
          Information, the Recipient agrees as follows:
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          <strong>A. No Disclosure.</strong> The Recipient will hold the
          Confidential Information in confidence and will not disclose the
          Confidential Information to any person or entity without the prior
          written consent of the Owner.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong>B. No Copying/Modifying.</strong> The Recipient will not copy
          or modify any Confidential Information without the prior written
          consent of the Owner.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong>C. Unauthorized Use.</strong> The Recipient will not copy or
          modify any Confidential Information without the prior written consent
          of the Owner.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong>D. Application to Employees</strong> The Recipient shall not
          disclose any Confidential Information to any employees of the
          Recipient, except those employees who are required to have the
          Confidential Information in order to perform their job duties in
          connection with the limited purposes of this Agreement. Each permitted
          employee to whom Confidential Information is disclosed shall sign a
          non-disclosure agreement substantially the same as this Agreement at
          the request of the Owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >III. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION - INJUNCTION.</strong
          >
          If it appears that the Recipient has disclosed (or has threate- ned to
          disclose) Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement, the
          Owner shall be entitled to an injunction to restrain the Recipient
          from disclosing the Confidential Information in whole or in part. The
          Owner shall not be prohibited by this provision from pur- suing other
          remedies, including a claim for losses and damages
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>IV. NON-CIRCUMVENTION.</strong> For a period of five (5) years
          after the end of the term of this Agreement, the Recipient will not
          attempt to do business with, or otherwise solicit any business
          contacts found or otherwise referred by Owner to Recipient for the
          purpose of circu- mventing, the result of which shall be to prevent
          the Owner from realizing or recognizing a profit, fees, or otherwise,
          without the specific written approval of the Owner. If such
          circumvention shall occur the Owner shall be entitled to any
          commissions due pursuant to this Agreement or relating to such
          transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>V. RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.</strong> Upon the
          written request of the Owner, the Recipient shall return to the Owner
          all written materials containing the Confidential Information. The
          Recipient shall also deliver to the Owner written statements signed by
          the Recipient certifying that all materials have been returned within
          five (5) days of receipt of the request.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>VI. RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES.</strong> Neither party has an
          obligation under this Agreement to purchase any service or item from
          the other party, or commercially offer any products using or
          incorporating the Confidential Information. This Agreement does not
          create any agency, partnership, or joint venture.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>VII. NO WARRANTY.</strong> The Recipient acknowledges and
          agrees that the Confidential Information is provided on an "AS IS"
          basis. THE OWNER MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT
          TO THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND
          ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
          PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE OWNER BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT,
          INDIRECT, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR
          ARISING OUT OF THE PERFORMANCE OR USE OF ANY PORTION OF THE
          CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Owner does not represent or warrant that
          any product or business plans disclosed to the Recipient will be
          marketed or carried out as disclosed, or at all. Any actions taken by
          the Recipient in response to the disclosure of the Confidential
          Information shall be solely at the risk of the Recipient.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>VIII. LIMITED LICENSE TO USE.</strong> The Recipient shall not
          acquire any intellectual property rights under this Agreement except
          the limited right to use as set forth above. The Recipient
          acknowledges that, as between the Owner and the Recipient, the
          Confidential Information and all related copyrights and other
          intellectual property rights, are (and at all times will be) the
          property of the Owner, even if sugges- tions, comments, and/or ideas
          made by the Recipient are incorporated into the Confidential
          Information or related materials during the period of this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>IX. INDEMNITY.</strong> Each party agrees to defend,
          indemnify, and hold harmless the other party and its officers,
          directors, agents, affiliates, distributors, representatives, and
          employees from any and all third party claims, demands, liabilities,
          costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, costs and
          expenses resulting from the indemnifying party's material breach of
          any duty, representation, or warranty under this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>X. ATTORNEY'S FEES. </strong> In any legal action between the
          parties concerning this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be
          entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>XI. TERM. </strong> The obligations of this Agreement shall
          survive from the Effective Date or until the Owner sends the Recipient
          written notice releasing the Recipient from this Agreement. After
          that, the Recipient must continue to protect the Confidential
          Information that was received during the term of this Agreement from
          unauthorized use or disclosure indefinitely
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>XII. GENERAL PROVISIONS. </strong> This Agreement sets forth
          the entire understanding of the parties regarding confidentiality. Any
          amend- ments must be in writing and signed by both parties. This
          Agreement shall be construed under the laws of the State of
          <span
            >&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</span
          >
          This Agreement shall not be assignable by either party. Neither party
          may delegate its duties under this Agreement without the prior written
          consent of the other party. The confidentiality provisions of this
          Agreement shall remain in full force and effect at all times in
          accordance with the term of this Agreement. If any provision of this
          Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remal-
          ning portions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
          and construed so as to best effectuate the original intent and purpose
          of this Agreement
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>XIII. WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION.</strong> This Agreement is in
